The InterestCalculator is a Java-based banking application designed to calculate the interest and maturity amount for Recurring Deposit (RD) accounts.
The calculation considers principal amount, tenure, age, and gender of the customer to apply the correct interest rate.
This project demonstrates:
-OOP concepts in Java (classes, objects, inheritance, packages).
-Exception handling with custom exceptions.
-Service-oriented design for separating business logic.
-Input handling and console-based user interaction.
